1. FUNCTIONALITY
================

DIME is a C++ class library for reading, constructing, manipulating, and
writing DXF file data.  The name is an acronym for DXF Import, Manipulation,
and Export library.

The focus of the library is primarily on loading DXF files and building
a data structure containing the DXF data, and on saving such data structures
as a file conforming to the DXF file format.  The intended purpose for
DIME was on importing and exporting DXF files.  For this kind of usage,
special memory management techniques can be used to boost the performance
significantly.

Aside from loading and saving the data structure, functionality is also
provided for traversing the data structure while performing various tasks,
and also some special functionality for extracting geometry from the DXF
data structure.

A sample program is included in the directory dxf2vrml/ which will convert
a DXF file (only the polygon data) to a VRML file.


2. TECHNICAL SUPPORT
====================

Systems In Motion (SIM) has no obligation to provide technical support
for the BSD licensed version of DIME.  If resources permit, however,
SIM will of course try to be as helpful as possible.

SIM has set up two mailing lists for DIME support.

dime-announce
  This mailing list is for announcements regarding DIME.  New releases,
  new functionality, license information, this kind of stuff.
  This list is moderated (read-only).

dime-discuss
  This mailing list is for discussing DIME.  Technical support can be
  provided through this discussion forum.  Followups to announcements
  in dime-announce should also be directed to this list.
  This list is open for posting for all subscribers.

To subscribe to either of the two lists, send an email to SIM's mailing
list manager at <listserv@sim.no> with a subject line with the format
"subscribe <listname>".  To unsubscribe, use a subject line with the
format "unsubscribe <listname>".  Do not include brackets around the
mailing list name.  For general information about SIM's mailing list 
manager, use "help" as the subject line.
