* Request from Rob Campbell <rob.campbell@att.net> on dime-discuss:

        I know that ACIS SAT is a proprietary, unpublished format.
        But shouldn't it be possible to extract the SAT data from a
        DXF file created by AutoCAD and create a standalone SAT file
        from it?  And, conversely, to split a SAT file into parts that
        can be put in a DXF file in the proper format?

  The specification of 7.0 is available at:
